## 🎯 Introduction  
An AI-powered dashboard that transforms financial services by offering:  
✅ **Hyper-personalized recommendations** (credit cards, loans, investments)  
✅ **Predictive business insights** (customer segmentation, churn prediction)  
✅ **Multi-modal search** (text + image-based product recommendations)  

### 🌟 Addressing 3 Industry Challenges:  
❌ **Generic financial advice** → ✅ AI-driven personalized recommendations  
❌ **Manual customer segmentation** → ✅ Automated insights & clustering  
❌ **Lack of predictive analytics** → ✅ AI-powered early warnings
